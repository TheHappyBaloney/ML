7. Create another .html file that contains a heading and a couple of paragraphs. 
    You could name this new file another_page.html, and you should place it into the same folder where your first .html is. 
    After you have created the new .html page, add a link to the first page so that the browser will load another_page.html when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. 
    You need to use the <a> and </a> tags in this exercise. Inside the tag <a> you need to use a href attribute that specifies which page will be loaded when the link is clicked.
8. HTML tags like <a> can have certain attributes. The href attribute is mandatory in the <a> tag. 
    Additionally it is possible to use the title attribute which specifies a text that emerges when the mouse cursor is moved above a link. 
    This kind of text is called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in the previous exercise so that a tool tip says "This leads you to another page." 
    when the mouse cursor is over the link.
9. It is possible to use a picture (image) as a link. Modify your page so that the picture that is on your page will also serve as a link that leads to another page.
10. Upload your two .html files to a server and test that they work as real internet pages.
